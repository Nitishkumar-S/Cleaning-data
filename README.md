# Cleaning-data
This is a R code to clean a dataset which is implemented as a course project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

Files included:
1.Codebook : This describes about the variables in "tidy_data.txt" which is created as a result of "run_analysis.R" code. And it also describes about the steps taken.
2.run_analysis.R : this file contains R code for carrying out the cleaning of dataset "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"

About the dataset used
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Activities considered while measuring data are:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
